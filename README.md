# UE4-ReachTask
This the implementation of a simple reach task in virtual reality for psychological studies.

## Motivation
Originally I wrote this in Python using Vizard for the practical courses in early semesters where students conduct their first research.

Now I want to see how capable the Unreal Engine 4 is for this. I'm using Blueprints, because psychology students often shy away from traditional text based code.
